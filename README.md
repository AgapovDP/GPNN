# GPdatasetCreator
GPNN is a neural network for solving the ghost polarimetry problem in the formalism of Jones matrices.
This repository has programs to create the datasets required for GPNN training.


GPdataset.py - dataset class for GPNN training

GP_Generator.py - dataset generation software

  Parameters:
  
  NameOfFile      - path to file;
  
  NumberOfObjects - number of objects in dataset;
  
  Noise           - value of noise.




Step by step to sart:

1. Open "GPNN_run.ipynb"
2. Download Your data or data from GPdataset.
3. Run "GPNN_run.ipynb"
